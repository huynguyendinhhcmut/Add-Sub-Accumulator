An accumulator is a circuit designed to continuously add or subtract the value of an input A to itself. This circuit features a carry-out signal from the adder and an overflow output signal. When input A is treated as a 2’s-complement number, an overflow condition is indicated (i.e., overflow signal set to 1) if the resulting sum does not accurately reflect a valid 2’s-complement result.
